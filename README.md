# Quantitative Finance Research Lab

This repository is a **project-based portfolio** exploring quantitative finance through short research problems implemented in Python.  
Each project investigates a core concept in trading, risk, or financial modeling â€” from Value-at-Risk to Monte Carlo simulations and credit scoring models.

## ðŸŽ¯ Purpose

To build a **research-oriented body of work** that demonstrates:
- Quantitative reasoning and mathematical modeling
- Python implementation for financial systems
- Simulation, risk analysis, and visualization
- Real-world applications in portfolio and credit risk

Each project starts from a question, formulates the math, derives the model, implements it in code, and interprets the results.
